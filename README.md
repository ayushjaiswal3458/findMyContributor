### Introduction
Our Website helps users to find their project partners based on their
required technologies skills. eg - If a user wants to find a partner that is
proficient in backend like Node.js , He/she can easily find and
communicate with the partner for their project contribution.

When we were searching for good partners to contribute on our college
minor project , it took several days to find each other to make a group .
So we decided to make something that can solve this problem and save
time in finding project partners , then the idea of this project came alive .

### Existing System
Our project is developed on VSCode using ReactJS , Javascript , CSS,
TailwindCSS and current is being updated on github .

VS code - Visual Studio Code is an Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features
include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code
completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

ReactJS - React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and opensource front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual
developers and companies.

Github - GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software
development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed
version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its
own features.


TailwindCSS - Tailwind is unapologetically modern, and takes advantage
of all the latest and greatest CSS features to make the developer
experience as enjoyable as possible. We've got first-class CSS grid
support, composable transforms and gradients powered by CSS variables,
support for modern state selectors like :focus-visible , and tons more.

### Feasibility of the project
A feasibility study is a high-level capsule version of the entire System
analysis and Design Process. The study begins by classifying the problem
definition. Feasibility is to determine if it’s worth doing. Once an
acceptance problem definition has been generated, the analyst develops a
logical model of the system. A search for alternatives is analyzed
carefully. Perform and evaluate feasibility studies like cost-benefit
analysis, technical feasibility, time feasibility and operational feasibility
for the project. Project Scheduling should be made using chats. Feasibility
study is carried out decide whether the proposed system is feasible for the
company. It begins with a request from the user for a new system.
It involves the following:

• Identify the responsible user for a new system.

• Clarify the user request

• Identify deficiencies in the current system

• Establish goals and objectives for the new system.

• Determine the feasibility for the new system

• Prepare a project charter that will be used to guide the remainder of
the Project. 

### Functional Specification
Requirement Gathering and analysis − All possible requirements of the
system to be developed are captured in this phase and documented in a
requirement specification document.

1.System Design − the requirement specifications from first phase are
studied in this phase and the system design is prepared. This system
design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and helps
in defining the overall system architecture.

2.Implementation − with inputs from the system design, the system is first
developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next
phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is
referred to as Unit Testing.

3.Integration and Testing − All the units developed in the implementation
phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post
integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.
4.Deployment of system − Once the functional and non-functional testing
is done; the product is deployed in the customer environment or released
into the market.

5.Maintenance − There are some issues which come up in the client
environment. To fix those issues, patches are released. Also to enhance
the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to
deliver these changes in the customer environment.

### Future Scope
In Future it will help a large scale users including students, college
students, school student to build interesting , creative projects based on
their selected partners for projects , which will advance the creativity of
the students , their practical knowledge, and practical working experience,
Team coordination , better communication skills, Soft skills. Hence
Developing individual overall Development, Which will ultimately
advance our production of Quality Engineers and hence Developing our
country as a Whole.
 Scope:
• Implementaion of a chat feature where two student can chat on this
web app.
• Integration with github, leetcode which make their profiles more
legit.
• Buy me a coffee or a Subscription feature.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
